This is a demo web app, built to showcase a basic Zaprite API integration.

## Demonstration

The example API integration showcases a demo customer dashboard where a payment is required. The following flow has been built:

1. The customer is presented with an amount to pay.
2. The customer clicks a button to initiate a payment.
3. The app uses Zaprite's API to create an Order (`/v1/order`), using the merchant's preferred Checkout and Payment Method options.
4. The customer is redirected to the `checkoutUrl` returned from the API.
5. The customer makes a payment and is redirected back to the `redirectUrl` specified in the original Order request.
6. A 'success' page uses the Order information to query the Order at Zaprite (`/v1/order/{id}`) and display the relevant information to the customer.
